**Mica For Everyone** is a tool to customize system backdrop on Win32 apps using [DwmSetWindowAttribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dwmapi/nf-dwmapi-dwmsetwindowattribute) and other methods.
It can apply Mica (or any other backdrop materials) on the non-client area (window frame) or background of supported apps and its behavior is customizable through a GUI and a config file.

> [!NOTE]
> You are viewing the WinUI 3 rewrite branch (2.x). For the source code of the older 1.x releases, please see [the `master` branch](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone/tree/master) instead.

> [!NOTE]
> Mica For Everyone is not responsible for rendering the effects you set, it just asks Windows to do that for you. If there's any problem with the effects it's a third-party issue. Try creating a rule for the affected apps and try different settings before opening an issue for it.
